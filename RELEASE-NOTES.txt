DigiDoc4J Java library public-0.2.16 release notes   ---------------------------------------- Support for handling ASiC-E XAdES (BDOC 2.1) digital signatures with time-stamps (denoted as LT level) and time-marks (denoted as LT-TM level).- Support for handling DDOC (DIGIDOC-XML 1.3) digital signature formats. - Support for using TSL (Trust service Status Lists) for obtaining trust anchor information.- Possibility to create signatures with PKCS#12 tokens and add signature values that are calculated in external systems. e.g. via browser plug-in. - Support for using RSA algorithm for cryptographic operations. ECDSA algorithm support will be added with the next iterations.- ASiC-E LT-TM signatures (BDOC 2.1 with time-mark) that are created with DigiDoc4J library are not compatible with JDigiDoc library's versions 3.9 and earlier.- Information about further developments can be found from Pivotal: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1110130. The library's API may be changed in the course of future developments according to feedback from users.
