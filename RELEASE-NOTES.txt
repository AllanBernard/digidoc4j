Updated DSS librariesKnown issues-------------Many of the DSS unit tests are broken because OCSP response is required in BDOCDigiDoc4j UriEncodingTest and MultiSignatureThreadSafetyTest are broken because test signing certificate is expiredIntelliJ IDEA project files are out of syncSome files (DSSSignedInfo.java and DSSXMLSignature.java) were leftover after merging the pull request with DSS refactered code. Hopefully nobody will miss themInteroperability with JDigiDoc: BDOC-TM (time-mark) files created with DigiDoc4j library can be validated with JDigiDoc version 3.10 or newer.Release 0.2.20 BETA-------------------Changes-------DSS has been updated to version 4.4.RC1DSS did a major refactoring of modules and some changes to APIFixed unit tests and code that broke because of DSS rafactoringKnown issues------------Interoperability problems with jDigiDoc:- OSCP certificate tag is missing RESPONDER_CERT id in signatures.xml file when BDOC is created with DigiDoc4j, but jDigiDoc requires that ID to be present. Note that RESPONDER_CERT id is not required by the BDOC standard.- BDOC-TM (time-mark) files created with DigiDoc4j library can be validated with JDigiDoc version 3.10 or newer.Release 0.2.18---------------New---It is possible to set TSL loading connection timeoutSigning certificate digest method is SHA256 instead SHA1Generates random nonce for OCSP request for TS signatureFixes------Bad error message (No revocation data for the certificate) for revoked OCSP replaced with "The certificate is revoked"Now is restricted to add 2 data files with same name from stream.Known issues-------------Interoperability with JDigiDoc: BDOC-TM (time-mark) files created with DigiDoc4j library can be validated with JDigiDoc version 3.10 or newer.Release 0.2.17---------------New----Verifies that the signature contains one signed properties referenceSupports signing with ECC signatureFixes------Signer's certificate validity now checked at OCSP response's produced at timeRevoked certificate now returns correct error messageKnown issues------------Interoperability with JDigiDoc: BDOC-TM (time-mark) files created with DigiDoc4j library can be validated with JDigiDoc version 3.10 or newer.Release 0.2.16 ---------------------- Support for handling ASiC-E XAdES (BDOC 2.1) digital signatures with time-stamps (denoted as LT level) and time-marks (denoted as LT-TM level).- Support for handling DDOC (DIGIDOC-XML 1.3) digital signature formats. - Support for using TSL (Trust service Status Lists) for obtaining trust anchor information.- Possibility to create signatures with PKCS#12 tokens and add signature values that are calculated in external systems. e.g. via browser plug-in. - Support for using RSA algorithm for cryptographic operations. ECDSA algorithm support will be added with the next iterations.- ASiC-E LT-TM signatures (BDOC 2.1 with time-mark) that are created with DigiDoc4J library are not compatible with JDigiDoc library's versions 3.9 and earlier.- Information about further developments can be found from Pivotal: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1110130. The library's API may be changed in the course of future developments according to feedback from users.
